    "Reviewed the BRFSS2015 codebook to understand the dataset more in depth. Check the column names, shape, info, summary statistics for each of the columns and unique values of the dataset. Started cleaning the data for missing values or NaN values and duplicates. The data did not have any missing values, NaN's or any duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looked into the value counts for each feature to understand the dataset and made a histogram for the data to see the distribution of features and see any useful values that may need to be investigated further. The value counts for each of the features gave a picture on how many people were diabetic or not, how many male or female, how many had high BP or high cholesterol and so on which may be of use in later analysis.\n",

    "Also look at the mean, median and mode of the data to see if it showed any use on categorical and non-categorical features of the data. The mode of the data is of interest in that most of the features will likely help in analyzing which features would be a good predictor for diabetic risk. Lastly, group the data by diabetes_binary to further see if the features will be of use in predicting risk factors for diabetes. In here, the data showed some association with the different risk predictors for diabetes, but not conclusive. \n",
